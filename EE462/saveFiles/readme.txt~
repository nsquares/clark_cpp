I worked alone on this problem. I did not use any sources.


The commands used to generate the static library are:

gcc -c cfact.c primes.c  
ar crv libmathCU.a cfact.o primes.o

I needed to first make object files and not run the linker.




The commands used to run the driver test1.c using the library are:

gcc -fPIC -o test.out test1.c libmathCU.a -std=c11
./test.out 

A different compiler verison was used because the given test file used newer C constructs like loop initialization declaration.


The output was:
