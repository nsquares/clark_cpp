/*

a useful awy to think about member functions

-constructors (so its like when making instances of objects, just put data in the objects in one line as well)
    -declare variable of an object of a class and initialize it
    -create a new object
    -same name as class
    -can be overloaded
    -dont return
    -not even void (no types)
    -just build 
    -there is a special form with 0 parameters

    -"create private data or store stuff in them" -Nathan Nguyen


-accessors
    -we built these last class
    -"use private data" -Nathan Nguyen
-mutators/modifiers 
    -"change private data" -Nathan Nguyen



-do not use private and public in structs even tho it is possible and structs are really similar to classes
-book and prof. say that classes should be the only ones that mix public and private scopes in common and good c++ coding practices





-go look at lecture 19 for the constructor work we did today
