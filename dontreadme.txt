--- Write this all in the Terminal on the bottom of VScode to run your cpp programs ---

g++ example.cpp             //produces exe
g++ example.cpp -o name     //produces exe with "name"

./name                      //executes the .exe you just built from the command just above me

--- Terminal Cmd ---
clear                       //clears






--- Passing in HW ---
//copy code from VScode and use right-click in putty/emacs to paste

cp HW1.cpp /afs/cu/class/cs141/s21/nguyennt     //example command

//cp means copy over to that directory





----- Java ------

javac *.java              //compile all java files
                          // in current working directory

java -cp D:\Documents\_clarkson_code_classes\EE363 hw1.p1.NameOfClassThatHasTheMainMethodInIt

//no .class at the end because you are trying to give the name of the class within that file 
//and dont have the classpath and the package overlap even though they are kind of similar, 
//I have not researched into what exactly the package is yet and Faraz has said nothing about it.

// -cp stands for classpath and this is for helping the Java virtual machine (jvm) to find where the fuck your files are 
//and the package (hw1.p1) is also kinda connected to the path of the class file and not but like Faraz wants it this way
