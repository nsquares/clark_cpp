lab1.txt

Question 1:
ls does not show anything. This is because I just created this directory and have not
created or stored any files in it yet.

Question 2:
The command does not perform as intended. What really happened was that it created a new
file called 'docs' and copied the contents of file1.txt over to it. No new directory was
made as it was placed right next to file1.txt. This command probably did not work because
the docs directory has not been made yet and assumed it will be a new file instead under
the lab1 directory. 

Question 3:
file1.txt no longer exist because the mv command seems to have renamed the file1.txt to
file3.txt. file3.txt does have all the contents of file1.txt.

Question 4:
The rmdir command did not work. This is because it told me that the directory is not empty.
In other words, it is because file3.txt is in it or any file in general is in it.
