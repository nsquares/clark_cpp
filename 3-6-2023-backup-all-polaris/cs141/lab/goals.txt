I am taking this course because it is required for my major which is Computer Engineering. 
I have taken many AP computer science classes in high school and have been the lead 
programmer of a FRC team. I do not know c++ as well as I know java, c#, python, and SQL so
I am happy that this class is at least in a new programming language for me.
